# Expenses Tracker

Track expenses across 2 credit cards, QR code payment and cash payment with automated email detection and manual receipt/screenshot scanning.

## Database

Location: `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db`

### Payment Methods

A master table for all kinds of payments

| id | name | notification sender |
|----|------|-------------------|
| 1 | Lexus | info@tscubic.com (TS CUBIC) |
| 2 | Amazon | statement@vpass.ne.jp (Vpass) |
| 3 | PayPay | screenshot |
| 4 | Cash | receipt |

### Transactions

Record all payment transactions from cards, paypay or cash.

Schema:

```sql
transactions: id, payment_method_id, date, store, amount, category, note, created_at
```

## Scripts

Scripts that will be used in this skill

### mail_fetch

Fetch new messages in my Gmail account with a provided mail sender list, also manage a database to save processed mails for deduplication
Usage: mail_fetch <sender1> <sender2> ...
These <sender>s don't need to be a full mail address, it can be part of address, ex. a postfix from `@` like `@gmail.com`, etc
Output: Save all email content to a temp file, and print the file path to the stdout
Notes: max fetching number is: 20
Location: `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/tools/mail/mail_fetch`

### expense_add

Insert a transaction record into the expenses database.
Usage: expense_add <payment_method_id> <date> <store> <amount> <category> <note>
  date:     'YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm' or 'YYYY/MM/DD' — time portion is stripped automatically
Location: `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/tools/database/expense_add`

---

## MODE 1: Automated Email Checking

When asked to "check card emails" or triggered by cron:

### Step 1: Run the script to fetch expense emails for 2 cards

```bash
$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/tools/mail/mail_fetch "info@tscubic.com" "statement@vpass.ne.jp"
```

This fetches all new emails sent by "info@tscubic.com" "statement@vpass.ne.jp" after last fetch date, deduplicates, and output clean content text to a temp file. The temp file path is printed by stdout as 'Save all emails content to file: <temp_file_path>'
If output says `NO_NEW_EMAILS`, skip step 2 and 3, go to step 4 directly.

### Step 2: Parse email content and extract expense fields

Read the temp file got at step 1, for each email in the file, according to different email sender, extract the following transaction fields based on the email information with different strategy.

- payment_method_id
  - `info@tscubic.com` -> 1 (Lexus VISA)
  - `statement@vpass.ne.jp` -> 2 (Amazon Mastercard)
- date: look for content about '利用日'
- store: look for content about '利用先'
- amount: look for content about '利用金額'
  - if the unit is not yen, ¥, or 円, then detect the currency and convert the amount to JPY with the laest currency, then record the orinal amount, unit, and currency as <note>
- category: Assign categories based on store name keywords
  - コンビニ, Lawson, ファミマ, セブン, 7-Eleven → Food
  - スーパー, イオン, ライフ, まいばすけっと → Groceries
  - Amazon, アマゾン → Shopping
  - Suica, PASMO, JR, 電車 → Transport
  - レストラン, 食堂, 居酒屋, マクドナルド, スターバックス → Dining
  - ガソリン, ENEOS, Shell, 出光 → Gas/Fuel
  - 薬局, マツモトキヨシ, ドラッグ → Health
  - Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, サブスク → Subscription
  - 電気, ガス, 水道, NHK → Utilities
  - Other for anything that doesn't match
- note
  - if the original amount unit was not JPY, and a currency conversion hapened, record the amount, unit, currency to this field
  - any other important information or memo that needs to be recorded, set to NULL if there is no

### Step 3: Run the script to insert transaction record

For each extracted transaction data, insert to sqlite3 database by the following command

```bash
$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/tools/database/expense_add "<payment_method_id>" "<date>" "<store>" "<amount>" "<category>" "<note>"
```

### Step 4: Report results

After processing all emails, summarize with this format:

```
💳 Email Check Complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
New transactions found: X
New entries:
  • Lexus VISA — ¥3,000 at Store A (YYYY-MM-DD)
  • Amazon Mastercard — ¥500 at Store B (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

New entries shows each transaction

If the request comes from user chat, send message to that channel, if it's a cron job, send message to the channel specified by cron setting `--to`.

## MODE 2: Manual Receipt or Screenshot Scanning

When user uploads an image in Slack:

### Step 1: Processes the image

The imageModel automatically processes the image (configured separately)

Extract transaction fields based on this strategy
- payment_method_id: if hard to detect, ask user directly instead of guessing by yourself
  - A regular receipt photo -> Cash
  - A Paypay app screenshot -> PayPay
- date: convert the format to YYYY/MM/DD
- store
- amount: use the same rule as MODE 1 Step 2
- category: use the same rule as MODE 1 Step 2
- note: use the same rule as MODE 1 Step 2

### Step 2: Show parsed data and ask "Is this correct?" before inserting

### Step 3: Run the script to insert to table transaction

Exactly the same command in MODE 1 Step 3

---

## MODE 3: Manual Text Entry

When user says something like "spent 1500 yen at Lawson with PayPay":

### Step 1: Parse to generate the transaction fields

- payment_method
  - if no info from user input, use 'Cash' as default
  - paypay or sth like this -> 'PayPay'
  - user may say 'iD' or 'id' or "ID" -> 'Amazon Mastercard'
- date: message date, also use format YYYY/MM/DD
- store: 'Unknown' as default if no user input, no need to confirm
- amount: use the same rule as MODE 1 Step 2
- category: use the same rule as MODE 2 Step 2
- note: use the same rule as MODE 1 Step 2

### Step 2: Run the script to insert to table transaction

Exactly the same command in MODE 1 Step 3

### Step 3: Report to user

Use this format

```
✅ Recorded: ¥1,500 at Lawson (PayPay) — Food
```

## MODE 4: Reports

There are 2 cron jobs to ask you to give a daily and monthly report based on transactions data.

### DAILY REPORT

Query yesterday's transactions AND this month's accumulated total.

**Yesterday's details:**

```bash
sqlite3 -header -column $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT pm.name AS payment_method, t.store, t.amount, t.category
FROM transactions t
JOIN payment_methods pm ON t.payment_method_id = pm.id
WHERE t.date = date('now', '-1 day', 'localtime')
ORDER BY pm.name, t.amount DESC;
"
```

**Yesterday's subtotals by card:**
```bash
sqlite3 -header -column $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT pm.name AS payment_method,
       printf('¥%,.0f', SUM(t.amount)) AS total
FROM transactions t
JOIN payment_methods pm ON t.payment_method_id = pm.id
WHERE t.date = date('now', '-1 day', 'localtime')
GROUP BY t.payment_method_id;
"
```

**Month-to-date accumulated total (include in every daily report):**
```bash
sqlite3 -header -column $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT pm.name AS payment_method,
       printf('¥%,.0f', SUM(t.amount)) AS month_total
FROM transactions t
JOIN payment_methods pm ON t.payment_method_id = pm.id
WHERE t.date >= date('now', 'start of month', 'localtime')
GROUP BY t.payment_method_id;
"
```

```bash
sqlite3 $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT printf('¥%,.0f', COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0)) AS grand_total
FROM transactions
WHERE date >= date('now', 'start of month', 'localtime');
"
```

**Daily report format:**

```

### MONTHLY REPORT

Reports on the PREVIOUS month's data (e.g., on April 1st, report March data).

**Last month's totals by card:**
```bash
sqlite3 -header -column $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "

  AND t.date < date('now', 'start of month', 'localtime')
GROUP BY t.payment_method_id
ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC;
"
```

**Last month's grand total:**
```bash

## MODE 5: FLEXIBLE DATE QUERIES

For any user request about a custom time range ("last week", "last 3 days", "this week", "March", etc.), use these SQLite date patterns:

**Date filter patterns:**
| User says | SQL WHERE clause |
|-----------|-----------------|
| today | `date = date('now', 'localtime')` |
| yesterday | `date = date('now', '-1 day', 'localtime')` |
| last 7 days / this week | `date >= date('now', '-7 days', 'localtime')` |
| last week (Mon-Sun) | `date >= date('now', 'weekday 1', '-14 days', 'localtime') AND date < date('now', 'weekday 1', '-7 days', 'localtime')` |
| last 30 days | `date >= date('now', '-30 days', 'localtime')` |
| this month | `date >= date('now', 'start of month', 'localtime')` |
| last month | `date >= date('now', 'start of month', '-1 month', 'localtime') AND date < date('now', 'start of month', 'localtime')` |
| specific month (e.g. March 2026) | `date >= '2026-03-01' AND date < '2026-04-01'` |
| specific date range | `date >= 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND date <= 'YYYY-MM-DD'` |

**Template for any date range query:**

Summary by card:
```bash
sqlite3 -header -column $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT pm.name AS payment_method,
       COUNT(*) AS txns,
       printf('¥%,.0f', SUM(t.amount)) AS total
FROM transactions t
JOIN payment_methods pm ON t.payment_method_id = pm.id
WHERE {DATE_FILTER}
GROUP BY t.payment_method_id
ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC;
"
```

Details:
```bash
sqlite3 -header -column $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT t.date, pm.name AS payment_method, t.store, t.amount, t.category
FROM transactions t
JOIN payment_methods pm ON t.payment_method_id = pm.id
WHERE {DATE_FILTER}
ORDER BY t.date DESC, t.amount DESC;
"
```

Grand total:
```bash
sqlite3 $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT printf('¥%,.0f', COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0)) AS total
FROM transactions
WHERE {DATE_FILTER};
"
```

By category:
```bash
sqlite3 -header -column $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_HOME/data/expenses.db "
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS txns, printf('¥%,.0f', SUM(amount)) AS total
FROM transactions
WHERE {DATE_FILTER}
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;
"
```

Replace `{DATE_FILTER}` with the appropriate clause from the table above.

## Error Handling

- If amount can't be parsed, ask the user
- If card can't be determined, ask the user
